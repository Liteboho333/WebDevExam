<p>
  Hi! My name is Liteboho Makatsela, and I'm a 19-year-old student currently studying Computer Programming. I'm passionate about technology and enjoy learning how to build websites and applications. I'm just a girl who loves discovering new things and growing in the tech world.

  In my free time, I enjoy getting lost in a good novel — fiction is my favorite, and I love exploring different stories and worlds. I also consider sleeping one of my hobbies; there’s nothing better than a good nap to recharge! Most of all, I find joy in learning to code and discovering what I can create through programming.
